### Snake

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a growing snake,
navigating it around the screen to collect food while avoiding collisions
with walls and its tail. Each piece of food eaten causes the snake to
grow longer, increasing the challenge as the game progresses. The goal is
to achieve the highest possible score before the snake runs out of space 
or collides with itself.

### Pong

Pong is one of the earliest arcade games and a timeless classic in the 
gaming world. It simulates table tennis where two players control paddles
on opposite sides of the screen, attempting to hit a bouncing ball back and forth.
The objective is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.
The game is simple yet highly competitive, requiring quick reflexes and precise timing.

### Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is not a game in the traditional sense but a cellular 
automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of 
cells that evolve through generations based on simple rules: cells
can live, die, or multiply depending on the number of neighboring cells.
Despite its simplicity, the game creates complex and often beautiful patterns,
illustrating systems' emergence and self-organization principles.
